# BF-design-with-DL
This is the simulation code for the paper "Beamforming Design for Large-Scale Antenna Arrays Using Deep Learning". 
The paper is available in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03657](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03657)

## requirements:
***
* Tensorflow >= 1.12.0
* Scipy

## How to use:
***
* run the train.py to train the model 
* run the test.py to test the trained model
* **Due to the space limitation of github, we provide two tiny training and testing data sets only for running the example.**

## Data sets and trained models
***
* Thanks for the authors of [[10]](http://oa.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/dailinglong/publications/paper/Reliable%20beamspace%20channel%20estimation%20for%20millimeter-wave%20massive%20MIMO%20systems%20with%20lens%20antenna%20array.pdf), the simulation codes of the channel is provided [here](http://oa.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/dailinglong/publications/publications.html). you 
can use the [direct URL](http://oa.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/dailinglong/publications/code/Reliable%20beamspace%20channel%20estimation%20for%20millimeter-wave%20massive%20MIMO%20systems%20with%20lens%20antenna%20array.zip) to download it.
* The channel estimation codes can be referred to the website of the first author of [[2]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6847111).
* We have provided the data sets in our [google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nSk9TftoCMA5iRUqC9GSK5g5a67Q8FRG), which can be directly used in our .py files.
* Trained weights, corresponding to the shown results in the paper, is also provided in the [google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nSk9TftoCMA5iRUqC9GSK5g5a67Q8FRG).
