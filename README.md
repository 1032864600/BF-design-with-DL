DNN_HBF
====
This is the simulation code for the paper "Beamforming Design for Large-scale Antenna Arrays with the Help of Deep Learning Approach" and
we highly respect reproducible research. 
.py file
----
Due to the limitation of file size, we only upload the executable .py files in the github repository:     
1. BFNN_Model.py : Architecture of the proposed BFNN model.      
2. load_samples.py : used to load samples of train set or test set.    
3. main_imperfect_CSI.py : simulate with imperfect CSI    
4. main_erfect_CSI.py : simulate with perfect CSI   
Samples and trained models
----
We have shared our generated samples and trained models by onedrive. Please kindly refer to 
After download the files, you can straightforwardly run main_erfect_CSI.py or main_imperfect_CSI.py.
Just easily copy the packages path in the python console, the program can load the data for training or testing.
Similar operation can help you load our trained model, which is corresponding to the results in our paper.
In addition, we also provide the matlab codes on onedrive so you can generate samples by yourself.

My email is lint17@fudan.edu.cn and we  welcome discussions. As I'm new to programing, I have tried my best to 
add more comments in .py files for ease of comprehension. If you have any questions, you can contact me by email.
Sorry for my English, hopefully this work can be helpful to you.
