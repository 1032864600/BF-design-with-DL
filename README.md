# BF-design-with-DL
This is the simulation code for the paper "Beamforming Design for Large-Scale Antenna Arrays Using Deep Learning". 

## requirements:
***
* Tensorflow >= 1.12.0
* Scipy

## How to use:
***
* run the train.py to train the model 
* run the test.py to test the trained model

## Data sets and trained models
* Thanks for the authors of [10], the simulation codes of the channel is provided [here](http://oa.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/dailinglong/publications/publications.html). you 
can use the [direct URL](http://oa.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/dailinglong/publications/code/Reliable%20beamspace%20channel%20estimation%20for%20millimeter-wave%20massive%20MIMO%20systems%20with%20lens%20antenna%20array.zip) to download it.
* The channel estimation codes can be referred to the website of the first author of [2].
* We have provided the data sets in our google drive, which can be directly used in our .py files.
* The trained weights, corresponding to the shown results in the paper, is also provided in the google drive.

## End
